      <p>
        React is a JavaScript library for rendering user interfaces (UI). UI is
        built from small units like buttons, text, and images. React lets you
        combine them into reusable, nestable components. From web sites to phone
        apps, everything on the screen can be broken down into components. In
        this chapter, youâ€™ll learn to create, customize, and conditionally
        display React components.
