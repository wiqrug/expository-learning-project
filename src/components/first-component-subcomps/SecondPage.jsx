      <h2>Defining a component </h2>
      <p>
        Traditionally when creating web pages, web developers marked up their
        content and then added interaction by sprinkling on some JavaScript.
        This worked great when interaction was a nice-to-have on the web. Now it
        is expected for many sites and all apps. React puts interactivity first
        while still using the same technology: a React component is a JavaScript
        function that you can sprinkle with markup. Hereâ€™s what that looks like
        (you can edit the example below):
      </p>
    </>
  );
};

export default SecondPage;
